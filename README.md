## 📸 Screenshots (optional)

Add screenshots to showcase the UI and user flow.

- Place images in an `assets/` or `images/` folder
- Reference them here using Markdown:

```
![Home](assets/home.png)
![Services](assets/services.png)
```

---

## 🧭 Navigation

All main links are standard anchors that route to separate HTML pages:

- Home → `index.html`
- About → `/pages/about.html`
- Services → `/pages/services.html`
- Contact → `/pages/contact.html`

Ensure relative paths in anchor tags and assets are correct based on your structure.

---

## 🧪 Tips & Notes

- Keep CSS modular in the `css/` folder and reuse components where possible
- Place any interactive behaviors in `js/` and avoid inline scripts when you can
- Test all relative links locally and after deployment
- Use semantic HTML for accessibility and SEO
